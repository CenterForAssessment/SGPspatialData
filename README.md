Repository for United States School District Shape Files
-------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains [topoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson) shape files for school districts in each state in addition to a shape
file for the continental United States. The files are for use in data visualizations. The files are derived from
[shape files](https://www.census.gov/did/www/schooldistricts/) created by the United States Census Bureau converted to topoJSON and made freely
available by the [Center for Assessment](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment) for the use by others. Source code utilized to convert shape files to topoJSON is available [here](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/SGPspatialData/blob/master/Shape_Files/District_Creation.R).
